1) Scrum Story points app (Dowload and watch the video of demo at https://github.com/HarishAtGitHub/Android/blob/master/Scrum%20Estimates/Demo-Video/ScrumCardAndroid-demo.mov and then click raw to download)

What is the app all about ?

    This app is used by members of a team following scrum .This can be used while the team estimates the size of the story which they are going to do
    in a particular Iteration. This makes us get rid of the physical cards.
