This app was done using a mobile development framework called  -------> phonegap .
The designing was done using ------------> jquery mobile library .

/Scrum Estimates/assets/www/apis has javascript files for other stuff in mobiles like accelerometer , compass , messages .
This is left as such for the time being without being deleted , so that it can be used if incase our app needs new features .
